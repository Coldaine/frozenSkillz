# Skill Review Tracker

> **Source of truth** for the skill quality gate. Most skills are held in `_incubator/`
> (de-registered from the marketplace) until they pass a review pass. Active marketplace
> skills are limited to reviewed, installable workflows.

**Established:** 2026-05-28
**Gate decision:** strict — `doppler`, `external-skill-intake`, and `omc-reference` are active and on the
marketplace menu; older reference/workflow skills remain gated pending review.
**Holding location:** `_incubator/` (in-repo, easy to promote back; not installable).
**Linear:** planning lives in Linear — project **frozenSkillz** (under the *ClaudeReconfigurations*
initiative, team Moosegoose/MOO), parent intake [MOO-561](https://linear.app/moosegoose/issue/MOO-561)
+ one triage sub-issue per gated skill (MOO-562 … MOO-570). Also registered in Notion → Builder Lab →
Projects (per the documented "Issues live in Linear; design/projects live in Builder Lab" split).
This file stays the in-repo source of truth for required work; Linear tracks status. Keep them in sync.

## How this works

1. Gated skills live under `_incubator/` and are **not** listed in any marketplace catalog, so they cannot be installed.
2. Each skill below has a status and a list of required work. Take a pass at one, do the work, then **promote** it.
3. **Promote** = move the skill dir back to its plugin's `skills/` folder, re-add it to the relevant manifests
   (the three root marketplace catalogs + the plugin's own `plugin.json` / `gemini-extension.json` `skills[]` array),
   and bump the plugin version.
4. Update this tracker when status changes.
5. Scout snapshots live under `_incubator/scout/` until they are reconciled into the skill rows below or deleted.

### Promotion bar ("ready")
A skill may be promoted when it meets the bar set by `doppler` (the reference standard):

- [ ] Description: clear trigger + when-to-use; under ~300 chars; negative triggers where useful.
- [ ] Content is current and factually verified (paths, commands, flags actually exist).
- [ ] Cross-platform where it matters (PowerShell + POSIX).
- [ ] Any referenced `scripts/` have been **run** and work (existence ≠ correctness).
- [ ] No project-specific or opinionated assumptions leaking into a "universal" skill.
- [ ] Progressive disclosure: heavy detail in `references/`, SKILL.md stays lean.

## Status board

| Skill | Tier | Linear | Status | Location | Required work |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `doppler` | A | — (done) | ✅ **ACTIVE** (on menu) | `plugins/frozen-skills/skills/doppler` | None — reference standard. |
| `external-skill-intake` | A | — | ✅ **ACTIVE** (on menu) | `plugins/frozen-skills/skills/external-skill-intake` | Workflow for sandboxing, scoring, evaluating, and packaging external inspiration repos before promotion. |
| `omc-reference` | A | — | ✅ **ACTIVE** (on menu) | `plugins/frozen-skills/skills/omc-reference` | Maintains the separate Oh My ClaudeCode installation; verified against the local OMC 4.14.4 source and explicitly excluded from ordinary Codex delegation, Git, commit, and unrelated-skill routing. |
| `pdm-cli-operations` | A | — | 🛑 gated · **live evaluation** | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/pdm-cli-operations` | Install the current same-major official client on the operator host; execute the eval cases against a live PDM; revise from traces; then promote. |
| `plugin-authoring-guide` ("skill guide") | A | MOO-562 | 🛑 gated · **rework** | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/` | **Rework** (user directive). |
| `mcp-deployment-guide` ("MCP guide") | A | MOO-563 | 🛑 gated · **update** | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/` | **Update** (user directive). |
| `agent-config-megaref` | A | MOO-564 | 🛑 gated · **light update** | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/` | Light update **+ confer/cross-reference with the LLM archiver project** (user directive). |
| `setup-rules` | B | MOO-568 | 🛑 gated | `_incubator/frozen-rules/skills/` | Tiny fix + verify rule install flow. |
| `gh-common-workflows` | B | MOO-565 | 🛑 gated | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/` | De-opinionate (remove NORTH_STAR / Codex-specific assumptions); verify refs. |
| `stacked-pr-workflow` | B | MOO-566 | 🛑 gated | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/` | Run + verify the 7 PowerShell helpers; decide if niche is worth keeping. |
| `skill-manager` | B | MOO-567 | 🛑 gated | `_incubator/skill-manager/` | Verify scripts + registry assumptions (`skills.sh`, `~/.agents/skills`). |
| `session-skill-inferencer` | C | MOO-569 | 🛑 gated · **highest concern** | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/` | Fix generation quality before any promotion (see below). |
| `skill-injector` (was skill-classifier) | C | MOO-570 | 🧪 **registered · experimental/UNTESTED** | `plugins/skill-injector/` | Test end-to-end before enabling; finish internal rename (scripts/module + ADR/doc prose still say "classifier"). |
| `icepanel-api` | A | — | 🛑 gated · **incubating** | `_incubator/frozen-skills/skills/icepanel-api/` | Live-validate diagram push on a real landscape; attach PNG/share proof to examples; run layout/push scripts; trim description to the ~300-char bar before promotion. |

Legend: ✅ active · 🛑 gated (in `_incubator/`) · 🧪 inert/experimental · Tier A = strong reference, B = functional/narrow, C = rework.

## Scout intake

| Intake | Status | Location | Required work |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coldaine-infra/skills/frozen` submodule snapshot (`c2868ee2c0b49eaecdbd365bc00ffec0685487fe`) | scout · incubated | `_incubator/scout/2026-06-16-coldaine-infra-skills-frozen-submodule/` | Compare against current `_incubator/` and `plugins/skill-injector/`; frozen-rules + `gh-common-workflows` matched current incubator files in the 2026-06-16 audit, but `agent-config-megaref`, `mcp-deployment-guide`, `plugin-authoring-guide`, and old `skill-classifier` hook/script/test files have deltas that need review before promotion or deletion. |

## Per-skill notes

### `doppler` — ACTIVE
Security-first reference skill: lean `SKILL.md` (rules + intent table + workflow), progressive
`references/` (setup, commands, CI/fallbacks), gated `references/homelab-notes.md` for coldaine/ESO/Shipwright
only, and `evals/triggers.json` for description routing checks. Synced from
`C:\Users\pmacl\.agents\skills\doppler` on 2026-07-16 to match the promotion bar (WHAT/WHEN description,
no project diary in the body, progressive disclosure).
Use it as the quality bar for everything else.

### `external-skill-intake` — ACTIVE
Required workflow for evaluating external skill/plugin/agent repos. It keeps source snapshots read-only under
`_incubator/scout/`, requires inventory, artifact rubrics, live eval evidence, and a packaging decision before any
candidate idea moves into active marketplace content.

### `omc-reference` — ACTIVE

Configuration and troubleshooting reference for Oh My ClaudeCode, a separate Claude Code orchestration plugin.
The live and frozen copies were verified against the local OMC 4.14.4 checkout. The skill deliberately reads the
active installed OMC sources instead of preserving a copied command or agent catalog, and it does not govern normal
Codex delegation, Git, commits, pull requests, or unrelated skill use.

### `pdm-cli-operations` — GATED, LIVE EVALUATION

Small shared process-interface skill for Codex, Hermes, and human operators using the official
`proxmox-datacenter-manager-client`. The design keeps endpoint, fingerprint, auth ID, and fleet identities in each
environment's owning operational repository, uses JSON output and `--password-command`, follows asynchronous tasks
to terminal state, and preserves native PVE/PBS as break-glass rather than introducing another standing control
plane. On 2026-07-20, the official PDM no-subscription amd64 index offered client 1.1.6, matching the documented
homelab PDM version. Promotion remains blocked until the client is installed on the Hermes operator VM and the
bundled live evaluation cases pass without credential disclosure.

### `plugin-authoring-guide` ("skill guide") — REWORK
- **User directive:** needs to be reworked.
- Currently comprehensive (11.6kb) and structurally fine, but rework per user. Re-verify every claim against
  current Claude Code plugin/skill docs (frontmatter fields, invocation controls, hook events) — the platform moves fast.

### `mcp-deployment-guide` ("MCP guide") — UPDATE
- **User directive:** probably needs updating.
- Re-verify config-file locations and env-var substitution syntax per tool; confirm the `mcp/` templates
  (`github.json`, `notebooklm.json`, left at repo root) are still accurate.

### `agent-config-megaref` — LIGHT UPDATE + ARCHIVER CROSS-REFERENCE
- **User directive:** needs a little updating, **and must confer / cross-reference with the LLM archiver project**
  (`D:\_projects\llm-archiver`) because they hold some of the same information.
- The overlap is the **per-tool file-path knowledge** (where each agent tool stores config / sessions). The archiver
  is the canonical source for tool coverage and on-disk locations — reconcile this skill's platform maps against it so
  the two don't drift. See `D:\_projects\llm-archiver\docs\CONSUMERS.md` and `schema\base.sql`.

### `setup-rules` — small fix
- Remove the uncertain `claude rules list   # (if such a command exists)` line; verify the actual rules-load behavior.
- Small installer for the 3 templates in `_incubator/frozen-rules/rules/` (all present).

### `gh-common-workflows` — de-opinionate
- Bakes in project-specific assumptions ("NORTH_STAR alignment", "canonical scope docs") and Codex-specific framing.
- Make it genuinely universal or scope it down honestly. References present and intact.

### `stacked-pr-workflow` — verify scripts
- Complete (4 workflow docs + 7 PowerShell helpers + graphite maps; supplementary docs in `docs/stacked-pr-workflow/`).
- "Files exist" was verified; **script correctness was not**. Run each `.ps1` before promoting. Decide whether this
  niche workflow earns a slot.

### `skill-manager` — verify scripts + assumptions
- Full `instructions/` + `scripts/` + `templates/` present. Depends on the `skills.sh` registry and assumptions like
  `~/.agents/skills/` (Kimi). Run the scripts and confirm the registry/path assumptions hold.

### `session-skill-inferencer` — highest concern, fix generation quality
- **This skill produced the 5 junk auto-generated skill dirs that were deleted from the repo root on 2026-05-28**
  (e.g. `gemma-35b-mtp-locallargelanguagemodels/`). Names were garbage; bodies were raw chat fragments.
- Structurally fine and self-documenting, but its *output* is the slop the gate exists to stop. Do **not** promote
  until the generation prompts produce clean, well-named, genuinely useful skills. See
  `docs/skill-review/session-skill-inferencer-changes.md` for prior refactor rationale.

### `skill-injector` (renamed from `skill-classifier`) — registered, experimental/UNTESTED
- Built by a parallel session and merged to `main` (PRs #22/#23): two hooks sharing a swappable LLM backend
  (Ollama default, Gemini CLI fallback) — a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that injects a relevant-skill suggestion, and a
  `PreToolUse` (Agent/Task) hook that injects advisory feedback on subagent prompts.
- **Renamed 2026-05-28:** the plugin directory, the skill folder, and all four plugin manifests are now
  `skill-injector`. Re-registered in all four marketplace catalogs, flagged `experimental` / UNTESTED.
- **Still NOT installed or enabled** anywhere (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude.json`, this repo — no
  `enabledPlugins`). The hooks do **not** run; it is dormant code until someone installs + enables the plugin.
- **TODO before relying on it:** test end-to-end; then finish the rename internally — the Python scripts/module
  (`skill_classifier.py`), the env vars (`SKILL_CLASSIFIER_*`), the ADRs, and the SKILL.md/README prose still say
  "classifier". Left as-is for now to avoid breaking the untested hook wiring.

### `icepanel-api` — incubating
- Salvaged from the stale `tempstore` branch (PR #34) onto a clean base; only the skill dir was taken — the branch's
  AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md rewrites, `.kilo/plans/`, and `_incubator/temp_sandbox/` were left behind.
- Structurally sound: lean `SKILL.md` router → `reference/**` + `workflows.md`/`diagrams.md`; all internal links resolve;
  `agents/` briefs present; UTF-8 clean.
- **Before promotion:** live-validate a diagram push (attach PNG/share-link proof to `examples.md`), run the layout/push
  scripts documented in `scripts/README.md`, and trim the description (~500 chars) to the ~300-char promotion bar.
- **Fidelity gap (adversarial review 2026-07-16):** `schemas.md` enums/required-field lists and the response keys in
  `examples.md` (`{url,defaultUrl,shareLink}`, `.diagramExportImage.id`, `fileUrls.png`) are hand-transcribed and not
  yet diffed against the live IcePanel OpenAPI. Verify each against a real response before promotion.

## Loose ends to reconcile when promoting

- **`mcp/` templates** (`mcp/github.json`, `mcp/notebooklm.json`) left at repo root; `mcp-deployment-guide` references them.
- **`docs/stacked-pr-workflow/`** supplementary docs left in place for the gated `stacked-pr-workflow` skill.
- **Root `README.md`** and **`CLAUDE.md`** still describe the pre-gate lineup and the old `skill-classifier` name —
  update them (and the plugin's own README + ADRs) to `skill-injector`, and point them here, once the gate is settled.

## Personal skills intake (2026-07-06)

Reference copies of the user's own `~/.agents/skills` personal skills, brought in so frozenSkillz owns a copy for
evaluation (the "own a reference copy of all my skills" directive). **Held in `_incubator/personal-skills/` — gated,
not installable, in no manifest.** Deliberately separate from the marketplace-candidate gated skills above.

**Rewrite rule:** live edit in `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`, then mirror into `_incubator/personal-skills/<name>/`, update this
tracker row, and **commit + push in frozenSkillz the same session**. Opening an Issue is not enough. “Gated” means not
marketplace-promoted — not “leave uncommitted.” Full contract: `docs/workflows/skill-authority-and-frozen-sync.md`.

**Excluded on purpose:**
- `deepinit` — ships in the OMC package (`oh-my-claude-sisyphus/skills`); an *installed plugin* skill, not authored here. Not intake material.
- `doppler` — already **ACTIVE** in `plugins/frozen-skills/skills/`.

**Drift found during intake (fix separately):**
- `edit-opencode-config` lived only in `~/.claude/skills/` (real dir, not a `.agents` junction) — missing from the canonical `~/.agents/skills` root. Copied here from `.claude`.
- `~/.claude/skills/omc-learned/` holds learner notes (`edit-opencode-config.md`, `phantom-substrate-inheritance.md`) — a half-promoted staging area to reconcile.

| Skill | Provenance | Status | Work before promotion |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chat-history` | authored (hardened 2026-07-06) | 🛑 gated | De-personalize (paths, Pieces, UTC-5); run `artifact_hunt.py` / `extract_chat_history.py`. |
| `retrospective` | authored (`author: pmacl`) | 🛑 gated | De-personalize (agent-control-plane paths); run `session_timeline.py`. |
| `project-docs` | authored (rewritten 2026-07-16; [#37](https://github.com/Coldaine/frozenSkillz/issues/37)) | 🛑 gated · evaluate | Live + incubator synced: kill PROGRESS/`docs/history` defaults; Issues/plans + promote-then-delete; AGENTS router; CLAUDE→AGENTS; restored `SKILL.md`. Still gated — do not marketplace-promote until promotion bar + de-personalization pass. |
| `skill-install` | authored | 🛑 gated | Verify recipes/paths. |
| `run-opencode` | authored | 🛑 gated | Verify commands. |
| `edit-opencode-config` | authored (was `.claude`-only) | 🛑 gated | Fix canonical-root drift; verify. |

| `google-stitch-ui-designer` | **provenance unconfirmed** | 🛑 gated · confirm origin | External-tool guide; confirm authored vs downloaded. |

Next pass: confirm provenance on the 5 unconfirmed, fix `insight-extractor` frontmatter, then decide which earn promotion toward active (each needs de-personalization + manifest entries + version bump per the promotion bar).

### PR #35 review findings (routed 2026-07-06)

Automated review of the intake PR — **Kilo 13 + Copilot 7, all WARNING (0 critical)**. These are gated reference copies = faithful snapshots of the live `~/.agents/skills` source, so fixes land in the **live source and re-sync at promotion**, not in the frozen snapshot. Routed here as promotion-work:

**Expected — de-personalization (the headline promotion gate):**
- `chat-history/SKILL.md` L43/L61/L214 (`D:\_projects`), L68 (`C:\Users\pmacl`).
- `retrospective/SKILL.md` L81 (`pmacl`), L132/L278 (`D:\_projects`).
- `edit-opencode-config/SKILL.md` L31 (`pmacl`).

**Genuine bugs to fix in the LIVE source, then re-sync:**
- `chat-history/extract-chats.sh` L59 — `while read` missing `-r` (backslash corruption). *Real bug.*
- `chat-history/extract_chat_history.py` L15 — docstring lists a `gemini` extractor that isn't implemented; implement or drop.
- `insight-extractor` — no YAML frontmatter; self-contradictory paths (`~/.Codex` vs `~/.claude`) at L7/L43/L55.
- `review-claudemd/SKILL.md` L4 — frontmatter `name` ≠ dir name (breaks discovery/dedupe); L15 — duplicate `-name "AGENTS.md"` in the `find` example.
- `run-opencode/driver.mjs` L8 — header says all-but-`backup` is read-only, but `profile` also writes `oh-my-openagent.json[c]`; fix the comment.

These do not block the *intake* (faithful capture); they are the evaluation TODO that must clear before any skill here is promoted to active.
